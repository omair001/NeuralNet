# NeuralNetworks

In the summer of 2018, the TAs of York university were on a strike. As a result, almost all courses had been halted. Instead of taking this time off, Bardia Goharanpour and I contacted professor Jeff Edmonds to work on a self learning course. This course is called Directed Studies(EECS 4070) where the students and professor choose an area of study that interests them and create a course with course projects and learning outcomes that must be approved by the EECS department. 

This course was largely self-taught under the supervision and guidance of the professor and taught us many areas of machine learning and neural networks.

This project was based on a previous convolutional neural network assignment that was a part of the course. It required obtaining and processing images, manipulating the webcam and screen display, and training and predicting based on images captured in realtime. The report goes into more detail about the specific application of this neural network and learning outcomes.
